# Web Scrapping 

## Introduction

Web scraping is an automatic method to obtain large amounts of data from websites.
Most of this data is unstructured data in an HTML format which is then converted into
structured data in a spreadsheet or a database so that it can be used in various applications. 
There are many different ways to perform web scraping to obtain data from websites. 
These include using online services, particular API’s or even creating your code for web 
scraping from scratch. Many large websites, like Google, Twitter, Facebook, StackOverflow, etc. 
have API’s that allow you to access their data in a structured format. 
This is the best option, but there are other sites that don’t allow users to access large 
amounts of data in a structured form or they are simply not that technologically advanced. 
In that situation, it’s best to use Web Scraping to scrape the website for data.

## Lifecycle 
I have used basic project Lifecycle.
1. first we have enter object we want to scrap by the user and then scrapper start searching website 
2. we have specified flipkart webside link and hardcoded in our code 
3. The product enter by the user is search automatically by our scrapper fuction 
4. then it goas to Review section of perticular product and extract all the information like
product name, price, reviewer name, and Review and our website shows in a beautifull ways in 
page itself 
this is how my project works.
